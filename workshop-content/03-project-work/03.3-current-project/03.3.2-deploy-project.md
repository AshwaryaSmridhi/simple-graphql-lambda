# Deploy

So now that you have an overview of the project provided to you. Lets deploy it!

## What are we going to do
- Log onto our AWS Account
- Keep our aws profile names handy
- Run `serverless deploy` or `sls deploy`
- If you have multiple profile `serverless deploy --aws-profile <profile-name>` or `sls deploy --aws-profile <profile-name>`
- Wait for serverless to generate a link
- Go into our AWS accounts and explore what has been created
    - Lets go to the API gateway and see what is there.
    - Lets go to AWS Lambda and see what is created
- Now do a cURL api call `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: AWS <AccessKey>:<SecretKey>" "https://439y2x4cy8.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/generate/germanshepherd/name"`. Please note this command will not work in PowerShell. In windows we also might have to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` to be able to run cURL.
- Enter a wrong breed name and do another call `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: AWS <AccessKey>:<SecretKey>" "https://439y2x4cy8.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/generate/wrongbreed/name"` and an error should show up.
