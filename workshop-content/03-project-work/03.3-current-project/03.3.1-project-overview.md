# Current Project - Dog name generator Lambda

The project provided to you will generate dog names based on the breed provided by the user.

## What is in it?
Our aim was to keep this project very simple yet meaningful. So what is better than dogs! 🐶
- It is a NodeJS lambda with handler defined in `src/handlers/generate-dog-name/generate-dog-name.js`. 
- We are using a `dog-names` npm package to get the names. 
- We are throwing some errors when the dog breed user input doesn't match any dog breeds from `src/lib/dog-breed.json`.
