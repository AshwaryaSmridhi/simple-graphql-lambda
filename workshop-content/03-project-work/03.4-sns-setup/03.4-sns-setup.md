# Create an SNS Topic

An SNS Topic is more like a communication channel. It follows a PubSub (Publisher-Subscriber) model. Where a particular service publishes messages to an SNS topic and a replica of that message is sent to all the services subscribing to that topic like Email, HTTP Endpoint (NodeJS app etc.), SQS, Texting. AWS SNS is always a one (SNS Topic) to many relationship.

The `AWS::SNS::Topic` resource creates a topic to which notifications can be published.

## Create an SNS Topic
The below code is the minimal code to create an SNS topic. We don't need `TopicName` property either but AWS CloudFormation will generate a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the topic name.

```
<SNSName>:
      Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
      Properties: 
        TopicName: <TopicName>
```
