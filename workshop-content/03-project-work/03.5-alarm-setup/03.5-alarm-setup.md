# Cloudwatch Alarms

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.

# Create an alarm
We'll be setting up a metric alarm based on the response the endpoint returns to the user. In this case we only want to be notified when there are 500 errors. The alarm action that we'll set for when it changes from `OK` to `ALARM` state will be sending a message to the SNS Topic we created earlier.
